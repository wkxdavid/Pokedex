        <h2>Problem Descripton</h2>
        <p>Pokemon is a very popular video game among children, however the price to
          play Pokemon could be very expensive to certain demographics. This is due to
          the need to buy new game consoles and new games as the series expands. Since
          Pokemon costs money, a problem that arises is that people who may want to play
          or get to know the different Pokemon that exist may not be able to afford buying
          the different cards or merchandise that would have otherwise helped them get familiar
          with the Pokemon brand. Thus, the information technology problem is that a low-cost,
          highly interactive system for becoming familiar with Pokemon does not exist and the
          creation of one would help spread Pokemon a lot more. The existing attempt to solve
          this problem is the <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex">official Pokedex</a> that has
          been created by the original inventors of Pokemon. It aimed to provide easily
          searchable information about each Pokemon, however, there was a lack of interactivity
          that encouraged people from diverse backgrounds to begin exploring Pokemon that our
          solution aims to provide.</p>

        <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
        <p>The users of this application are people who are interested in pokemon but might not be in the financial position to get deep into pokemon. There is a lot to buy when trying to play a pokemon game. Our proposed app features consist of a pokedex, a guessing game, and a shop. For the pokedex, we intend to make the pokemon that are out there viewable and showcase the different aspects about them. This consists of the moves they can use or learn, states they have, or the individual biography of each pokemon. For the guessing game, it will allow for the user to test their knowledge on each pokemon they have looked at from the dex and also allows a way for the user to customize their own individual pokedex to their liking. For the shop, it will allow for users to individualize the look of their pokedex to give it the feeling like it is theirs. It will also allow users to earn coins that they can use to purchase more game options. All these features will be created using an         <a href="https://pokeapi.co/">API</a>. Our intention with this app is to have the pokemon franchise be more accessible to the general public; mainly the people who do not have the finances to purchase all of the components to a pokemon game (like the console, the games, different addons, etc.) </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pokedex: We can view the pokemon that are out there and learn about different aspects about them. The moves they can use or learn, states they have, or the individual biography of each pokemon.</li>
          <li>Guessing game: This guessing game will allow for the user to test their knowledge on each pokemon they have looked at from the dex and also allows a way for the user to customize their own individual pokedex to their liking.
          </li>
          <li>Shop: This shop will allow for a user to individualize the look of their pokedex to give it the feeling like it is theirs. It will also allow users to earn coins that they can use to purchase more game options.</li>
